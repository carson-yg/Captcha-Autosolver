									<h3 class="major">Captcha Solver</h3>
									<p>CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test and is used to tell computers and humans apart. It is used by some web sites to ask users' input and restrict the usage of computer bots.</p>
									<p>There are many types of CAPTCHAs and we are going to use the most simple one - A text image to demonstrate how to solve it. There are many libraries available to help solve the text in CAPTCHA, like Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Google Vision API, or Amazon Textract. In this project I plan to use the images generated by <a href="http://captchas.net/" target="_blank">captchas.net</a> and feed them to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/drag-and-drop" target="_blank">Google Vision API</a></p>									
									<p>I used Tomcat with a Spring boot framework and jQuery. When a user accesses the web page, a request is sent to captchas.net to get the image then saved in the folder of the server. A request to Google Version API will help resolve the text in Captchas. </p>

									<p>While developing the solver, I noticed that the existing libraries like OCR and Google Vision API detected correct text at a very low percentage. It only has a 20% success rate, which is probably due to the text images generated by captchas.net being hard to read by both humanns and the libraries.
